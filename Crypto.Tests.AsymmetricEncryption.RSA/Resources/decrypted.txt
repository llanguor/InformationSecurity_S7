RSA encryption is one of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems in the world.
Named after its inventors, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, RSA relies 
on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large integers to provide security. 
 
Its applications span secure communication, digital signatures, key exchange, 
and data protection in both commercial and governmental contexts. Understanding 
RSA requires a combination of number theory, cryptography principles, and practical
implementation strategies.

At its core, RSA encryption is based on the concept of public and private keys.
The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used for decryption.
Unlike symmetric encryption, where both parties share the same secret key, RSA allows
anyone to encrypt a message using the recipient’s public key, but only the holder of 
the private key can decrypt it. This property is what enables secure communication over
insecure channels like the Internet.

The security of RSA depends on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime
numbers. Key generation begins by selecting two large primes, commonly denoted as p and q.
The product of these primes, n = p × q, forms part of both the public and private keys. 
The totient of n, which is (p-1) × (q-1), is used in calculating the private exponent.
Choosing a suitable public exponent e that is coprime with the totient ensures that the 
modular inverse exists, which becomes the private exponent d. This mathematical relationship
guarantees that encryption and decryption are inverses of each other modulo n.
